# code_lens
A simple, locally loaded webpage to highlight sources of frequent coding issues. code_lens is a self contained HTML page using simple JavaScript and CSS. You can use it while you're offline and without worrying that your source code is being submitted to some unknown server.

# Purpose
Programmers--especially novices--struggle with syntax and style issues where often a single missing semicolon causes code to fail.

code_lens is designed to reduce the extraneous cognitive load associated with looking at your source code in order to draw your attention to sources of frequent errors. All characters other than those of immediate interest are greyed out.

# To use
1. [Download this repository](https://github.com/WilDoane/code_lens/archive/master.zip) and, if necessary, unzip it.
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. Paste source code into the text area.
4. Review your code using any of the available lenses: parentheses, braces, brackets, comments, end of line characters, etc.
5. Tweak your source code to test changes.
6. Copy and paste your source code back into your preferred text editor.
