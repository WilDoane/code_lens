# code_lens
A simple, locally loaded webpage to highlight sources of frequent coding issues. code_lense is a self contained HTML page using simple JavaScript and CSS. You can use it while you're offline and without worrying that your source code is being submitted to some unknown server.

# Purpose
Programmers--especially novices--struggle with syntax and style issues where often a single missing semicolon causes code to fail.

code_lens is designed to reduce the extrinsic cognitive load associated with looking at your source code in order to draw your attention to sources of frequent errors: all characters other than those of immediate interest are greyed out.

# To use
1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. Paste source code into the text area.
3. Review your code using any of the available lenses: parentheses, braces, brackets, comments, end of line characters, etc.
